Uncover insights into candidate performances, voter behavior, and election dynamics through a meticulously crafted database schema and powerful SQL queries.

## 🌟 Project Highlights

- **Database Schema:** Delve into the election data effortlessly with a meticulously designed database schema.
- **SQL Queries:** Extract valuable insights using carefully crafted SQL queries, covering constituency-wise winners, total votes cast, and more.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bihar-election-results-2020-sql.git
Database Setup:

Install your preferred SQL database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
Execute the SQL script (election_results_schema.sql) to set up the database schema and populate it with the election data.
Run Queries:

Fire up your favorite SQL client (e.g., MySQL Workbench) to run and customize queries based on your analysis needs.
📊 Database Schema
Explore the project's structured database schema, including tables for candidates, constituencies, and votes.

candidates: Details about the candidates participating in the election.
constituencies: Information on the constituencies in Bihar.
votes: Data on votes cast, encompassing candidate ID, constituency ID, and vote count.
🔍 Sample Queries
Winners by Constituency:

sql
Copy code
SELECT constituency_name, candidate_name
FROM candidates
JOIN votes ON candidates.candidate_id = votes.candidate_id
WHERE votes.vote_count = (SELECT MAX(vote_count) FROM votes WHERE constituency_id = votes.constituency_id);
Total Votes Cast:

sql
Copy code
SELECT SUM(vote_count) AS total_votes
FROM votes;
Constituency with Highest Turnout:

sql
Copy code
SELECT constituency_name, COUNT(voter_id) AS voter_count
FROM constituencies
JOIN votes ON constituencies.constituency_id = votes.constituency_id
GROUP BY constituency_name
ORDER BY voter_count DESC
LIMIT 1;
